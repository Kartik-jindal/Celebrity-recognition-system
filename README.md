# Celebrity Recognition System

## Overview

The **Celebrity Recognition System** is a comprehensive machine learning project designed to recognize and identify celebrities based on their physical attributes, achievements, and other relevant data. This system can handle large datasets, provide real-time recognition results, and is accessible through both web and mobile applications. It is capable of adapting to new celebrities and sports as they emerge, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of recognition results over time.

## Problem Statement

Design and develop a recognition system that accurately identifies professional athletes and other celebrities based on various features such as physical attributes, achievements, and performance statistics. The system should be able to handle large amounts of data, provide real-time recognition results, and be accessible through a web or mobile application. It should also be capable of adapting to new celebrities and emerging sports, maintaining the accuracy and relevance of its recognition results over time.

## Methodologies Used

- **Face and Eyes Detection**: Utilizes the OpenCV library for detecting faces and eyes in images.
- **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**: Employs OpenCV for face detection and wavelet transforms for feature engineering.
- **Model Building**: Implements machine learning models using SVM, logistic regression, and random forest.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Uses GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.
- **Model Export**: Exports the trained model to a file and integrates it with a Python Flask server to handle HTTP requests generated by the UI.
- **UI Development**: Builds a user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Unique Features

- **Dynamic**: Continuously adapts to new data and celebrities.
- **No Other Dedicated Tool**: Offers unique functionality not available in existing tools.
- **Multi-Dimensional**: Recognizes various attributes such as clothing, sponsorships, teams, and events.
- **Simple and Accurate**: Provides an intuitive interface and reliable recognition results.

## Societal Impact

- **Improved Fan Engagement**: Enhances interaction and connection with fans through accurate recognition.
- **Better Sponsorship Decisions**: Allows for better tracking and analysis of sponsorships and endorsements.
- **Increased Transparency**: Promotes openness in celebrity and sports data handling.
- **Enhanced Industry Performance**: Supports improved organization and categorization of sports and celebrity data.
- **Fairness and Equality**: Contributes to a fairer representation of athletes and celebrities.

## Targeted Industries

- **Clothing Recognition**: Identifies clothing and equipment worn by sports personalities.
- **Sponsorship Recognition**: Detects logos and brands for tracking sponsorships and endorsements.
- **Team Recognition**: Recognizes the team affiliation of sports personalities.
- **Event Recognition**: Identifies the type of event or game being played for better data organization.
